Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ I'm Dave âœ¨ I'm a passionate career-changer who has recently embarked on an exciting journey into web development. âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on projects to build my portfolio and actively seeking a placement in an internship, apprenticeship, or junior developer role.

In addition to web development, I have a solid background in Graphic and 3D design, with skills in Blender, Inkscape, and GIMP. (The best things in life are indeed âœ¨freeâœ¨)

Because of my design background, I have a particular fondness for front-end web development and am eager to join a likeminded, enthusiastic team to create amazing web solutions together!

In my spare time, I love designing labels for bottles, creating awesome fantasy or nature-inspired 3D artwork, and enjoying a good Whisky or Rum ; )! That's when I'm not busy chasing after my 1-year-old!
