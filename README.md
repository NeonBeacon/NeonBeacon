### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

NeonBeacon/NeonBeacon is a repository âœ¨ super special to me âœ¨ because it's my very first shared project!âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

ðŸŒ± Right now, Iâ€™m getting the hang of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. But soon, this will be "I'm currently crushing it at Javascript, HTML, and CSS."

Iâ€™ve got some pretty nifty skills in Graphic and 3D design too, especially with Blender, Inkscape, and GIMP. (The best things in life are âœ¨<sup>free</sup>âœ¨)

In my spare time, I love designing labels for bottles, creating awesome fantasy or nature-inspired 3D artwork, and enjoying a good Whisky or Rum ; )! Of course, that's when I'm not busy chasing after my 1-year-old!
