### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**NeonBeacon/NeonBeacon** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its my first shared repository!âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently _learning_ Javascript, HTML and CSS. This will soon be updated to "I'm currently **_amazing_** at Javascript, HTML and CSS."

- I am also quite handy when it comes to Graphic and 3D design, specifically when using Blender, Inkscape and GIMP. (The best things in life are âœ¨<sup>free</sup>âœ¨)

In my spare time I like to design labels for bottles, create wonderful fantasy or nature inspired 3D art works and I enjoy a good drink whilst doing these ; )! This is when I'm not looking after my 1 year old.
